## Introduction

The interactive [killercoda] scenarios are a great way learn new technologies in
an _hands-on_ approach. However, creating the scenarios and managing can be
tedious and time consuming.

The `killercoda-cli` solves some of those problems by:

- Adding a new step after the existing last step and creating a directory for
  including foreground and background scripts placeholders.
- Adding a regular step with `background.sh` and `foreground.sh` scripts or a verify
  step with `verify.sh` script.
- Renaming and re indexing step files and directories allowing for inserting a
  step in between existing steps and moving content _down_
- Updating the `index.json` file to reflect changes in step order and titles.

## Documentation

Autogenerated API documentation generated in [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html) available
at: https://piotr1215.github.io/killercoda-cli/killercoda_cli/cli.html.

### Requirements

- The tool must be run in a directory containing step files or directories (e.g. step1.md, step2/).
- An `index.json` file must be present in the directory, which contains metadata about the steps.

## Usage

### Initialize a new scenario

In a new directory run `killercoda-cli init`. This command will trigger a wizard
to create a new scenario. After answering all the questions, the directory will
contain the following structure:

    .
    ├── index.json
    ├── intro.md
    ├── finish.md

### Add a new step

From here run `killercoda-cli` without arguments. This command will trigger a
wizard to add a new step. After answering all the questions, the directory will
contain steps in the similar structure:

    .
    ├── index.json
    ├── step1.md
    └── step2
        └── step2.md

And you want to insert a new step between `step1.md` and `step2/`, titled "New Step".

1. Run `killercoda-cli`.
2. Enter the title for the new step: "New Step".
3. Enter the step number to insert the new step at: 2.
4. Enter the step type (regular or verify): regular.

After running the tool, your directory structure will be updated to:

    .
    ├── index.json
    ├── step1.md
    ├── step2
        └── step2.md (previously step1.md content)
    └── step3
        └── step3.md (previously step2.md content)

The `index.json` file will also be updated to include the new step and renumber existing steps accordingly.

Before:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Step 1",
      "text": "step1.md"
    },
    {
      "title": "Step 2",
      "text": "step2/step2.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Step 1",
      "text": "step1.md"
    },
    {
      "title": "New Step",
      "text": "step2/step2.md"
    },
    {
      "title": "Step 2",
      "text": "step3/step3.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding assets

The `killercoda-cli assets` command has been added to facilitate the generation of necessary assets and folder structures in the current working directory using a predefined [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/Piotr1215/cookiecutter-killercoda-assets).

> [!NOTE]
> The assets are opinionated and may not fit all use cases, but it's a good
> starting point to add some interactivity to the scenario.

This command will generate the required folder structure and files directly in
the current working directory and **remove** the temporary directory.

Assets are NOT automatically added to the `index.json` to leave the decision to
the user how to bring the assets into the scenario.

## Development

Installing locally with `pip install -e . --user` will allow you to run the tool
locally.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following commands:

Here is the text rendered as a Markdown list:

* `hatch run test:unit` - to run the unit tests.
* `hatch run test:integration` - to run the integration tests.
* `hatch run test:coverage-report` - to generate the coverage report.
